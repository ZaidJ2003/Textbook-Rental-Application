## Project Overview

Project Name: Stock-Whisperers
Description: This project will be a textbook/kit marketplace where students at UNCC can sell their old textbooks/kits to other students. This web application will allow students to search for textbooks/kits and message sellers. It allows them to pick a meetup location to make the transaction (whether that be with cash or using a service like paypal). There will also be a review system allowing buyers to review sellers on things such as the quality of their textbooks/kits. The benefits of this softwares completion would be, helping students save money on textbooks/kits, reducing waste (people buying textbooks and kits just to sit on a shelf after the class is over), and allowing students to make their money back.
